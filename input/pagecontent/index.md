### Purpose

This Implementation Guide (IG) is designed to support the testing and validation of maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) referral workflows using HL7 FHIR standards. It ensures interoperability between point-of-care systems, community health tools, and referral hospitals. The guide provides a common framework to exchange referral requests, patient data, and outcomes between systems to improve continuity of care and referral loop closure.

### Background

Referrals are critical to saving lives in MNCH by enabling timely access to appropriate levels of care. However, current referral systems in many low-resource settings are fragmented, paper-based, or lack real-time communication, leading to lost or delayed care. Digital referrals standardized through FHIR offer a way to streamline communication across different facilities and platforms. This IG responds to the need for shared protocols in Nigeriaâ€™s digital health landscape.

###  Scope of the FHIR Implementation Guide

This guide defines core FHIR profiles for referral request, patient demographic exchange, encounter history, and referral outcome documentation in MNCH programs. It is intended for use in national and sub-national digital health systems, EMR/EHR vendors, and community health platforms. The focus is on referrals initiated at lower-level facilities or community points to higher-level health institutions for ANC, delivery, neonatal emergencies, and child illness. Members, get ideas from this CMS guide().

<!-- The scope of this guide focuses on the following core components:
- **Standardizing how immunization clients (patients) are registered and managed**, using the [**NgImmPatient**](StructureDefinition-NgImmPatient.html) profile.
- **Structuring immunization service delivery records**, such as vaccine administration, using the [**NgImmImmunization**](StructureDefinition-NgImmImmunization.html) profile.
- **Defining the necessary search parameters, RESTful operations, and data constraints** to ensure interoperable exchange of immunization data across digital platforms.
- **Providing the minimum data structures required** for systems to exchange immunization-related data across multiple levels of the health system, from point-of-care to national dashboards. -->

#### Use cases covered in this guide
The IG covers the following key use cases (which will continue to expand in subsequent iterations) by the Nigeria FHIR community:

- Referral from PHC to secondary/tertiary facility for high-risk pregnancy or complications.
- Community health worker to facility digital referral for newborn danger signs.
- Tracking referral response and outcomes to ensure loop closure.
- Notification to patients and providers on referral status updates.
